This python package provides an API for communicating with a Dygma keyboard.

WORK IN PROGRESS

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/brandonchinn178/dygma.git@master
```

## Syncing keyboard

The primary usage of this package is to configure your layers in YAML files
and then uploading those layers to the keyboard. To do so, write a YAML file
in the same format as `example/dygma.yaml` and run

```bash
dygma sync path/to/dygma.yaml
```
